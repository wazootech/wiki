# Memory Repo Best Practices

A **memory repo** is a per-owner wiki graph repository that is the durable store for one owner or organization's knowledge: typed wiki pages, per-source immutable datasets, connector code, and validation all live in one repository. This is the "wiki repository memory-first" model. This document is the spec that the [memory-first wiki repos issue](https://github.com/wazootech/wiki/issues/261) implements and that [connector memory wiring](https://github.com/EthanThatOneKid/ethanpedia/issues/45) builds against.

## Model

The wiki repository _is_ the memory. There is no separate data tier: raw captures, normalized records, cursors, and bookkeeping live in the same repository as the knowledge graph, so the graph and its sources cannot drift.

```
EthanThatOneKid/
  .github/       # identity, meta, policies         (uniform owner special repo)
  workspace/     # dev-surface harness               (uniform owner special repo)
  memory/        # the memory wiki repo               (uniform owner special repo)
```

## Naming

- **Uniform per-owner name:** the memory repo is named `memory` under each owner or organization, joining `.github` and `workspace` as the third uniform owner special repo. Examples: `EthanThatOneKid/memory`, `wazootech/memory`.
- **Role suffix:** the `-pedia` suffix previously designated knowledge repos (`ethanpedia`, `wazoopedia`). Going forward it describes the memory role: data repositories use the `memory` family, not `-pedia`. The `wazoopedia` repo has been renamed to `memory`.
- **Per-source datasets are subtrees**, not repositories: `raw/<source>/` inside the memory repo.
- **Escape hatch:** if a single source outgrows the shared repo (volume, access control, or CI isolation), split that subtree to a per-source repo named `<product>-<source>-memory` (e.g. `ethanpedia-calendar-memory`). Do not split preemptively.
- **Transcription:** repo and directory names use hyphens (`x-bookmarks`, `gemini-notes`); connector Python packages keep underscores (`x_bookmarks`, `gemini_notes`).
- **Page filenames:** standard wiki conventions (title-case, underscore, one file per entity).

## Repository structure

```
memory/
  README.md
  wiki/                         # typed knowledge graph (living documents)
  raw/<source>/                 # immutable captures, append-only (data)
    <capture-files>             # unique per-item filenames
  raw/<source>/.cursor          # monotonic opaque cursor (or .sync_token)
  raw/<source>/SUMMARY.json     # run bookkeeping
  raw/<source>/thread_ids.json  # per-source sidecar metadata (optional)
  connectors/<name>/            # connector code (centralized, not per-repo)
  queries/                      # saved SPARQL queries
  wiki.yml                      # graph context, validation config
  .github/workflows/
    memory-check.yml            # append-only + SUMMARY-schema invariant
    check.yml                   # wiki check + wiki fmt --check
```

`wiki/` pages are living documents. Everything under `raw/` is immutable and append-only; the only mutable files are the per-source metadata entries listed below.

## Continuity contract

A memory repo must be stable, unchanged, and replayable over time. It is the durable store that an ephemeral sandbox trusts — reproducibility is the property that makes host loss safe.

1. **Append-only by construction.** Capture files use unique per-item or per-run filenames (timestamp- or source-ID-based) and are never overwritten. Re-cloning therefore never conflicts on `git pull`, because append-only files cannot collide.
1. **No history surgery.** Never `force-push`, `reset`, or rewrite memory repo history. Enforce with branch protection: force-push and deletion disabled on `main`, administrator overrides off.
1. **Monotonic cursor.** Cursors advance only forward. Replays are idempotent and never regress state.
1. **Dedup by source identifier.** Every capture carries a source ID (`schema:identifier`); duplicate IDs within or across runs are skipped.
1. **No TTL, no pruning.** Memory is the second-brain promise: nothing expires because of age. The repo is the memory, not a cache of it.
1. **Run bookkeeping.** Each source keeps a `SUMMARY.json` that records the last run and its result; it doubles as the connector `status` output.
1. **Provenance, not copies.** Wiki pages reference captures through stable URLs or URIs (`raw:<source>/...` inside the repo, or `memory://<owner>/<source>/<path>` across repos) rather than inlining raw content.

## Datasets per source

Every connector owns one dataset subtree, `raw/<source>/`, with:

- **Immutable captures:** append-only files written once per item, named from the source identifier plus a readable slug (e.g. `raw/gmail/<message-id>-<slug>.md`).
- **cursor:** an opaque, monotonic position marker the connector reads at fetch start and writes only after the run succeeds. Canonical cursor filenames are `.cursor` (default) and `.sync_token` (incremental sync connectors such as Calendar and Gmail).
- **Mutable metadata whitelist:** `SUMMARY.json`, `.cursor`, `.sync_token`, `thread_ids.json`, and `.gitkeep` are the only mutable files under `raw/`; the memory-check invariant rejects any other modified, appended, or deleted path.
- **SUMMARY.json** — the standardized bookkeeping contract:

```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "connector": "<source>",
  "fetched": 42,
  "ingested": 5,
  "skipped_by_appraisal": 37,
  "actionable_candidates": 5,
  "cursor": "opaque-cursor-value",
  "lastRun": "2026-08-27T06:00:00-07:00"
}
```

Connectors expose a shared CLI: `python -m connectors.<name> status`, `fetch`, and `process <file>`. The shared accounting (cursor, capture, dedup, summary, CLI) is provided by `ConnectorBase`; the per-connector extraction, appraisal, and capture formatting are the only unique code.

## Connectivity and auth

The connector auth approach is intentionally **deferred (TBD)**: no third-party OAuth middleware (for example Nango or Composio) is prescribed. The preference is to hand-roll per-connector auth. Candidate mechanisms to evaluate before wiring each fetch:

- Google family (calendar, gmail, drive): OAuth device flow with refresh tokens stored in the secrets vault (and cloud secrets for the agent runtime)
- Signal: `signal-cli` on a persistent host
- X bookmarks: local fixture

Credentials never enter the repository; they live in the secrets vault and are injected by the orchestrator at run time.

## Runtime and orchestration

Daily automation runs as a scheduled GitHub Actions workflow (`connector-cron.yml`, daily 06:00 UTC), not a long-lived agent. Per run the workflow:

1. Clones the memory repo fresh.
1. Runs `python -m connectors.<source> fetch` for each scheduled source whose credentials are configured; a source with no credentials is **skipped, not failed** (each connector's fetch is gated on its secret being present).
1. Captures and bookkeeping land in the same clone.
1. Appraisal converts actionable captures into living records; the workflow generates and updates wiki pages from normalized data (a no-op until connectors emit appraised records).
1. Gates: `wiki check` and `wiki fmt --check`, plus `scripts/memory_check.py --base origin/main` and the pytest suite.
1. Commits one atomic change per run and pushes to `main` of the same repo; a run with no new captures is a no-op commit.

Hard gates are structurally enforced: validation runs before commit, and repository CI (`check.yml` + `memory-check.yml`) is the tripwire on push. Natural-language operators follow the atomic persistence protocol: one coherent transaction per commit, checkpoint commits when blocked, no destructive history operations without approval.

## Escape hatch criteria

Split a source to `<product>-<source>-memory` only when the shared repo is genuinely constrained:

- Raw volume or repository growth dominates the wiki's graph
- A source needs separate access control (e.g. personal data permissions differ from the rest)
- A source needs independent CI

Each split is its own reviewable change: move the subtree, re-point provenance links, and re-run validation.

## Roll-out

- **Step 1 (this document):** conventions agreed.
- **Step 2 — reference deployment (done):** the legacy personal wiki was renamed `EthanThatOneKid/ethanpedia` and archived; `EthanThatOneKid/memory` was re-created clean with the `raw/<source>/` per-source dataset scaffolding (fresh `SUMMARY.json` baselines, no legacy captures), `SUMMARY.json` + cursor conventions, branch protection, `check.yml` + `memory-check.yml` + `connector-cron.yml`, and the reference `ConnectorBase` + calendar scaffold. Tracked in [wazootech/wiki#261](https://github.com/wazootech/wiki/issues/261).
- **Step 3 — Calendar reference connector:** wire `ConnectorBase` + Google Calendar end-to-end through fetch, bookkeeping, page generation, and the daily cron loop. Tracked in [memory#1](https://github.com/EthanThatOneKid/memory/issues/1). Legacy discussion lives in the archived tracker at [ethanpedia#45](https://github.com/EthanThatOneKid/ethanpedia/issues/45).
- **Step 4 — replicate:** move each remaining connector onto the same pattern; stream-only provider imports stay gated on the [deferred imports ruling](https://github.com/EthanThatOneKid/ethanpedia/issues/28).
